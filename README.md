# Ei_O_T
Breadboard Friendly ESP32-S2 Development Kit / Breakout

All EI.O.T Boards are manufactured in either Europe or USA. There are NO genuine Boards made in Asia, and there probably never will be.
This is necessary to ensure quality and safety for the applications developed with our Development Kits and breakout boards.
USB-OTG functionality is built in Hardwarwe wise. Software support is currently under development.

The Board can be assembled in two ways allowing dominantly left and right handed Developers to optimally use it, also by flipping it upside down you can choose to have the USB cable stick out the top or bottom.

Safety and Handling Notice: 
This product is exclusivelly intended as an utility device for development under laboratory conditions. For use or operation specialist knowledge is required.
Assembly by yourself as askilled technician is required. The provided Firmware is only example code to confirm a correctly executed flashing process.
